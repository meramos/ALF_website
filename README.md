# ALF_website
Website where you can post about your lost pet, a pet you've found, or pet(s) that you're putting up for adoption.

I am developing this website as a side project with the purpose of gaining additional experience in web development as well as improving my resume.

So far in this project I've used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, MySQL, Javascript, jQuery, and AJAX.
